## Project assignment
There are several houses in which strange spooks haunt. Every spook has its own abilities and more of them can have the same ability. Every spook can haunt just in one house. The house is defined by the name, the adress (not entity), the date, when it started to haunt in the house and the brief history. The spook has the creepy name, the period from when to when it haunts (only one interval, it sleeps for the rest of the day) and the description how and why it haunts. The ability has the name, the description and so on.
